# Equation_dump
A method of machine learning that combines neural network math with human understandable solutions

This is a work in progress. 

Equation Dump:

Given that all machine learning is essentially the search for equations that best fit the relationships between given inputs and known outputs. 

Equartion Dump seeks to solve the problem of impossible to understand machine learning solutions. Equations dump takes the final mathematical 
structure of a basic deep learning model and puts it together in one source. Then ,rather than adjusting all the equations with back
propegation, it insteads scores all the randomly generated equations and DUMPS the bad ones and replaces them with new equations based
on which equations are curerently most succesful.

In this may, the method seeks to model the trial and error moethods that people employ. Trying differnet approaches to a problems, discarding the
ones that don't work and improving on those that do.

Anyone interested in colaborating on this project with me, please feel free to drop me a line.
